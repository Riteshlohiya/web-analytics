    "You may work in a small group.  Your project should be delivered in an IPython Notebook, and posted in GitHub.  Your project is due end of day Monday 6/25. You and your team should created a video presentation about your project. You should be ready to present your project in our Meet-up on Tuesday, June 26th. "
